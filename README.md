## City Fitness Genetic Algorithm

This program uses a genetic algorithm to solve a city fitness optimization problem. Genetic algorithms are search heuristics that mimic the process of natural selection to generate useful solutions to optimization and search problems.

## Hybrid Neuro-Fuzzy System

This program implements a hybrid neuro-fuzzy system, combining neural networks and fuzzy logic to leverage the strengths of both approaches. This system can learn from data and handle uncertainty effectively.

## Kohonen Network

This program implements a Kohonen network, also known as a Self-Organizing Map (SOM). SOMs are a type of artificial neural network used for clustering and visualization of high-dimensional data.

## Max-Min Composition

This program demonstrates the max-min composition of fuzzy relations, a fundamental operation in fuzzy set theory used in various fuzzy systems and applications.

## McCulloch-Pitts Neuron

This program implements the McCulloch-Pitts neuron, one of the earliest models of artificial neurons. It forms the basis for more complex neural network models.

## Perceptron

This program implements the perceptron algorithm, a type of artificial neuron that is the simplest form of a neural network. It is used for binary classification tasks.

## Travelling Salesman Problem

This program uses heuristic methods to solve the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP), an NP-hard problem in combinatorial optimization. The TSP seeks the shortest possible route that visits a set of cities and returns to the origin city.

## Washing Machine Fuzzy System

This program implements a fuzzy logic system to control a washing machine. Fuzzy logic systems are used to handle uncertainty and imprecision, making them suitable for real-world control systems.

## Fuzzy Operations

This program demonstrates basic fuzzy operations such as union, intersection, and complement. These operations are fundamental to fuzzy set theory and are used in various applications of fuzzy logic.

## Hebb's Rule

This program implements Hebb's rule, a learning algorithm based on the principle that neurons that fire together wire together. It is one of the earliest and simplest learning rules for neural networks.
